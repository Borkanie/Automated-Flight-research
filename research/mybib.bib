    \begin{abstract}
    Linear gaussian control (LQG) is a well suited control strategy when it comes to stabilitzing systems under a fixed set of operating conditions around a point. It provides a great mechanism to ensuring a stability margin for any real system with a high degree of non-linearity. It alos provides succesfull when used in conjugation with a system with states defined in different scales. This paper aims to develop a control strategy for a fixed wing aircraft that operates in windy conditions at a cruise altitude and it will Focus on a small scale Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) with no access to any wind sensors,thus relying on an estimator to dientify the wind's intensity and direction.While this sollutions yields sufficient for flying in a relative straight line relative to the starting point, it seems really promising when paired with a gain-scheduling mechanism.

\section{Introduction}
This research aims to present the reader with the basic information and walktroughs necessary to develop a cruise contrller for a fixed wing aircraft. It aims to introduce the reader in the basic concepts behind the fuild dynamics that appear during flight, and to present the challanges a reasearcher will have to face. It also aims to provide a viable soplution on the matter backed by simulations.
\section{Sytem of reference}
In order to apply Newton's equations of motion to the location and orientation of an aircraft when examining its dynamics, an appropriate inertial coordinate system must be used. Additionally, it is necessary to specify relative locations and velocities using multiple frames of reference, with the choice of which frame to use being a matter of convenience.A coordinate system fixed on the surface of the Earth is preferred to construct the velocity equations because sensors like the Global Positioning System (GPS) measure the aircraft's velocity in relation to the Earth. The information provided by sensors like rate gyros, on the other hand, is specific to the body of the vehicle where they are positioned. In light of this, a reference frame that is fixed to a moving object is the best choice for describing airplane angular rates.
\par
Solving a dynamic problem requires an inertial reference frame, $F^I$ , which is fixed or in uniform rectilinear translation relative to the distant stars. Meeting this requirement leads to the possibility of using the Newton's second law for the motion of a particle, which relates the external forces acting on the particle to its mass and acceleration relative to $F^I$ . Generally, the rotation of the Earth relative to such an inertial frame is neglected in the analysis of the flight dynamics. Therefore, any coordinate frame with the origin at a defined location on the Earth can be used as an inertial frame. Let $F^E$ denote the Earth-fixed reference frame having the origin close to the ground station and it's X axis indicating North, it's Y axis indicating East and it's Z axis indicating vertically. This coordinate system will further be used in order to describe the aircraft position and orientation relative to a fixed point on the surface of the earth. In order to use ignore the earth's coriolis effect we will work in a flat-earth
environment.The origin of the body fixed frame, depicted as $F^B$, coencides with the vehicles center of gravity. The x axis of this frame will always be point trough the nose of the aircraft, the y axis will be pointing trough the right wind, and the z axis will be pointing downwards. The body-fixed reference frame, $F^B$, has an angular velocity of in relation to $F^I$, depicted as $\varPhi=[p,q,r]^T$. The propulsive force act directly parallel to the x axis of the body-fixed system, but the aerodynamic forces are described by the velocity vector, orientatation. It makes they're respective interaction easier to understand if we use the body-fixed system. Furthermore, some onboard sensors, specially the inertial measurement unit, collect data in relation to the body frame.
\par
The Euler angles, which describe the three sequential rotations around the axes z, y, and x, that can be used to describe the orientation of $F^B$ with relation to $F^I$, are noted as $(\phi,\theta,\psi)$. Yaw$(\phi)$, pitch$(\theta)$, and roll$(\psi)$ angles rotate the airplane's body around the X,Y and Z-axes respectively.
The transformations that describes the rotations are:
 \begin{align}
    R_1(\phi) &= \begin{bmatrix}
        1&0&0 \\
        0&cos(\phi)&sin(\phi)\\
        0&-sin(\phi)&cos(\phi)
      \end{bmatrix}
      \label{PhiEulerRotation}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    R_2(\theta) &= \begin{bmatrix}
        cos(\theta)&0&sin(\theta) \\
        0&1&0\\
        -sin(\theta)&0&cos(\theta)
      \end{bmatrix}
      \label{thetaEulerRotation}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    R_3(\psi) &= \begin{bmatrix}
        cos(\psi)&sin(\psi)&0\\
        -sin(\psi)&cos(\psi)&0\\
        0&0&1
      \end{bmatrix}
      \label{PsiEulerRotation}
\end{align}
This allows us to define the complete rotational matrix from $F^I$ to $F^B$ as:
\begin{align}
    R_{BI}&=R_1(\phi)R_2(\theta)R_3(\psi)
    \label{BodyToEarthRotationMatrix}
\end{align}
\par
The wind reference frame, $F^W$ has the same point of origin like the body-fixed frame,namely the center of gravity of the aircraft.As depicted his X axes is rotated around the body U axis so that it aligns with the velocity vector of the aircraft. The y axis also reflects that by being rotated around the Z axis of the aircraft with an angle of sideslip  $\beta$. The Z axis still points down but now it is has also been rotated around the y axis with the same $\alpha$ angle,formally known as the angle of attack of the vehicle, just like the X axis. this frame will later be used to describe the aerodynamic forces acting upon ouur aircraft. The wind vector can also be denoted in the inertial reference frame and his components would be $omega w=[p_w, q_w, r_w]T$. The rotation matrix from body to wind reference frames can be defined as follows:
\begin{align}
    R_{WB}&=\begin{bmatrix}
        C(\alpha)C(\beta)&-C(\alpha)S(\beta)&-S(\alpha)\\
        S(\beta)&C(\beta)&0\\
        S(\alpha)C(\beta)&S(\alpha)S(\beta)&C(\alpha)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{WindToBodyRotationMatrix}
\end{align}
where $S()$ denotes sin and $C()$ denotes the cosine of the angle.
\section{Modelling an aircraft}
This section derives the mathematical model of our aircraft. It will be considered as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom. The Earth is considered flat and still for the purpose of simplicity, making $F^E$ a Newtonian frame of reference $F^I$. As long as the distances are close enough to the radius of the earth,we can assume the air density as constant, it should be emphasized that this approximation holds true for the majority of flight altitudes. The equations of motion are firstly derived under the presumption that the atmosphere is at rest with respect to the Earth, and the wind effect is then appropriately taken into account. The presentation in this section is mainly based on \cite{Aircraft Contorl and Simulation}, \cite{Dynamics of Atmospheric Flight}, \cite{Field Path Following for Miniature Air vehicles} textbooks.

\section{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

\subsection{Sections}

Use \texttt{section}s and \texttt{subsection}s to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use \texttt{ref} and \texttt{label} for cross-references --- this is Section~\ref{sec:examples}, for example.

\subsection{Tables and Figures}

Use \texttt{tabular} for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the files menu. To include it in your document, use the \texttt{includegraphics} command (see the comment below in the source code).

% Commands to include a figure:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{your-figure's-file-name}
%\caption{\label{fig:your-figure}Caption goes here.}
%\end{figure}


\subsection{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots
